# password-generator by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator. The challenge consists of creating an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes.
